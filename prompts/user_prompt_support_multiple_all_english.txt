Classify the following message, posted on social media in the weeks leading up to the 2025 Chilean presidential election, by indicating whether it explicitly expresses the author's support for, or a positive opinion of, any of the following candidates: Jeannette Jara, José Antonio Kast, Johannes Kaiser, Evelyn Matthei, Franco Parisi, Eduardo Artés, Harold Mayne-Nichols, or Marco Enríquez-Ominami (also known as MEO), or whether it does not express any of these opinions. Your answer should be based solely on the information contained in the message. A simple mention of a candidate cannot be interpreted as support for, or a positive opinion of, the author. Similarly, a post reflecting the opinions or political positions of a candidate does not necessarily imply the author's support for, or a positive opinion of, that candidate. Do not confuse retweets, indirect speech, or quotations with the opinion of the message's author. Be concise and reply only with the candidate's last name or "None". Here is the message: ${tweet}
