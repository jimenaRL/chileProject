Classify the following message, posted on social media in the weeks leading up to the 2025 Chilean presidential election, by indicating whether it explicitly expresses the author's support for, or a positive opinion of, Marco Enríquez-Ominami (also known as MEO). Your answer should be based solely on the information contained in the message. A simple mention of Enríquez-Ominami cannot be interpreted as support for, or a positive opinion of, the author. Similarly, a post reflecting the Enríquez-Ominami's opinions or political positions does not necessarily imply the author's support for, or a positive opinion of Enríquez-Ominami. Do not confuse retweets, indirect speech, or quotations with the opinion of the message's author. Be concise and respond only "YES" or "NO". Here is the message: ${tweet}
